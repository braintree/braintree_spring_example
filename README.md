# Braintree Spring Example

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/braintree/braintree_spring_example.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/braintree/braintree_spring_example)

An example Braintree integration for Spring (Java).

## Setup Instructions

1. [Install gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html) and project dependencies:

  ```
  ./gradlew build -x test
  ```

2. Copy the contents of `example.config.properties` into a new file named `config.properties` and fill in your Braintree API credentials. Credentials can be found by navigating to  Account > My User > View Authorizations in the Braintree Control Panel. Full instructions can be [found on our support site](https://articles.braintreepayments.com/control-panel/important-gateway-credentials#api-credentials).

3. Start server:

  ```
  java -jar build/libs/braintree_spring_example.jar
  ```

  This starts the server on port `8080` listening to all interfaces.

## Running tests

All tests are integration tests. Integration tests make API calls to Braintree and require that you set up your Braintree credentials. You can run this project's integration tests by adding your sandbox API credentials to `config.properties` and running `./gradlew test`.

## Testing Transactions

Sandbox transactions must be made with [sample credit card numbers](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/reference/general/testing/java#credit-card-numbers), and the response of a `Transaction.sale()` call is dependent on the [amount of the transaction](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/reference/general/testing/java#test-amounts).

## Pro Tips

* Run `java -Dserver.port=4000 -jar build/libs/braintree_spring_example.jar` to start the server on port 4000. Replace `4000` with any number to start it on a different port.
